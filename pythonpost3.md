# Python Post 3

>##### I'm doing my posts differently now because The last website I used for learning Python wasn't free so now I'm using Udemy. The course I'm taking is called: Introduction To Python Programming

The teacher for the course explained the basics very well and I was able to code a good amount of code without getting confused. Check pythonepost3code for the code.
