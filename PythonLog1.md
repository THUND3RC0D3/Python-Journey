So one day, I started learning how to code in Python, and my dad recommended this website called Checkio (https://py.checkio.org/) to learn that language.
When I started it up there was this island, I clicked on it and it showed a couple of instructions, the task was easy because something seemed familiar. The thing that made Python familiar was that the coding language was very similar to Lua, and if you check my repository, "About-Me" I have experience with Roblox Studio.
